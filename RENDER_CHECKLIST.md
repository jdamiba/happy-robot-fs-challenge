## Deployment Checklist

### Service Creation

- [ ] **Web Service created** - Selected "Web Service" from Render dashboard
- [ ] **Repository selected** - Connected to correct GitHub repository
- [ ] **Service name set** - e.g., `happy-robot-websocket`
- [ ] **Root directory configured** - Set to `websocket-server`
- [ ] **Runtime selected** - Node.js runtime chosen

### Build Configuration

- [ ] **Build command set** - `npm install`
- [ ] **Start command set** - `npm start`
- [ ] **Node version specified** - 18+ in package.json engines
- [ ] **Health check path** - `/health` endpoint configured

### Environment Variables

- [ ] **NODE_ENV=production** - Production environment set
- [ ] **ALLOWED_ORIGINS configured** - Includes your Next.js app domain
- [ ] **LOG_LEVEL=info** - Appropriate logging level
- [ ] **PORT variable** - Render sets this automatically

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Basic Connectivity

- [ ] **Service deployed successfully** - No build errors in logs
- [ ] **Health endpoint working** - `curl /health` returns 200
- [ ] **Stats endpoint working** - `curl /stats` returns data
- [ ] **WebSocket connection** - Can connect via `wscat`

### Advanced Testing

- [ ] **Broadcast endpoint** - POST to `/broadcast` works
- [ ] **CORS configuration** - Cross-origin requests allowed
- [ ] **SSL certificate** - HTTPS/WSS working properly
- [ ] **Multiple connections** - Can handle concurrent WebSocket connections

## Next.js App Integration

### Environment Updates

- [ ] **NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL set** - Points to Render WebSocket server
- [ ] **WEBSOCKET_SERVER_URL set** - Points to Render HTTP endpoint
- [ ] **CORS origins updated** - Includes production domains
- [ ] **Next.js app deployed** - With updated environment variables

### Integration Testing

- [ ] **Real-time updates working** - Changes sync between browser tabs
- [ ] **Project rooms functioning** - Users can join/leave projects
- [ ] **Message broadcasting** - API routes successfully send messages
- [ ] **Connection resilience** - Auto-reconnection after network issues

## Monitoring Setup

### Log Monitoring

- [ ] **Logs accessible** - Can view real-time logs in Render dashboard
- [ ] **Error monitoring** - Can identify and debug issues
- [ ] **Performance metrics** - Resource usage visible
- [ ] **Connection tracking** - WebSocket connections logged

### Health Monitoring

- [ ] **Health checks automated** - Regular monitoring of `/health` endpoint
- [ ] **Alert system** - Notifications for service downtime
- [ ] **Uptime tracking** - Monitor service availability
- [ ] **Performance tracking** - Response time monitoring

## Production Optimization

### Free Plan Considerations

- [ ] **Sleep mode understood** - Service sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- [ ] **Cold start handling** - ~30 second wake-up time accounted for
- [ ] **Keep-alive mechanism** - Prevent unnecessary sleep (optional)
- [ ] **Client reconnection** - Handles service wake-up gracefully

### Paid Plan Benefits (if applicable)

- [ ] **Always-on service** - No sleep mode with paid plans
- [ ] **Higher limits** - More concurrent connections
- [ ] **Custom domain** - Professional URL instead of onrender.com
- [ ] **Priority support** - Better support options

## Security Configuration

### CORS Security

- [ ] **Specific origins** - Only allow your domains, not wildcards
- [ ] **HTTPS enforcement** - All connections use secure protocols
- [ ] **Credential handling** - Proper CORS credential configuration

### Environment Security

- [ ] **Secrets management** - No sensitive data in code
- [ ] **Environment isolation** - Production vs development configs
- [ ] **Access control** - Proper authentication for admin endpoints

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Backup

- [ ] **Configuration backup** - Environment variables documented
- [ ] **Code backup** - Repository properly maintained
- [ ] **Deployment process** - Steps documented for recovery

### Disaster Recovery

- [ ] **Service restart process** - Know how to restart if needed
- [ ] **Rollback procedure** - Can revert to previous deployment
- [ ] **Alternative deployment** - Backup hosting option identified

## Cost Management

### Free Plan Optimization

- [ ] **Usage monitoring** - Track resource consumption
- [ ] **Efficient coding** - Optimize for minimal resource usage
- [ ] **Connection management** - Proper cleanup of WebSocket connections

### Paid Plan Planning

- [ ] **Cost analysis** - Understand pricing structure
- [ ] **Usage forecasting** - Predict when paid plan needed
- [ ] **Value assessment** - Benefits vs costs analysis

## Documentation

### Deployment Documentation

- [ ] **Process documented** - Steps written down for future reference
- [ ] **URLs recorded** - All service URLs documented
- [ ] **Environment variables** - Configuration documented
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions

### Team Knowledge

- [ ] **Team training** - Others know how to deploy/manage
- [ ] **Access sharing** - Team members have Render access
- [ ] **Process standardization** - Consistent deployment process

## Final Verification

### End-to-End Testing

- [ ] **Full user journey** - Complete workflow tested
- [ ] **Multiple users** - Collaboration tested with multiple browsers
- [ ] **Network resilience** - Works with various network conditions
- [ ] **Error scenarios** - Handles failures gracefully

### Performance Verification

- [ ] **Response times** - Acceptable performance metrics
- [ ] **Connection limits** - Can handle expected user load
- [ ] **Resource usage** - Within Render plan limits
- [ ] **Scalability** - Can handle growth

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Service won't start:**

- Check build logs for dependency issues
- Verify start command in Render dashboard
- Ensure all environment variables are set

**WebSocket connection fails:**

- Verify CORS configuration in ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- Check SSL certificate is working
- Test connection with wscat tool

**Real-time updates not working:**

- Verify Next.js app has correct WebSocket URL
- Check browser Network tab for WebSocket connection
- Monitor Render logs for broadcast messages

**Service sleeping (free plan):**

- Implement keep-alive mechanism
- Upgrade to paid plan for always-on service
- Handle cold start in client-side code
